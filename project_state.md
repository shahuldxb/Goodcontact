# Project State Tracker

## Current Issues
- Deepgram transcription error: "Bad Request: failed to process audio: corrupt or unsupported data"
- Despite using the correct API key (ba94baf7840441c378c58ccd1d5202c38ddc42d8), transcription is still failing
- Need to investigate if this is related to:
  - Audio file format/encoding issues
  - SAS URL generation/permissions
  - How the audio content is accessed by Deepgram

## Log Analysis
From recent logs:
```
DEEPGRAM RAW RESPONSE: {"result":null,"error":{"name":"DeepgramApiError","message":"{\"err_code\":\"Bad Request\",\"err_msg\":\"Bad Request: failed to process audio: corrupt or unsupported data\",\"request_id\":\"de726809-56f6-4fc0-baad-8d210a1ccc08\"}","status":400}}
```

## API Key Status
- Environment variable shows: 1f6c8f9cc2378ba0c6c5dd0d60d3d8713f89bfff
- Working hardcoded key in files: ba94baf7840441c378c58ccd1d5202c38ddc42d8
- Found inconsistent key in test_direct_transcription.py: d6290865c35bddd50928c5d26983769682fca987
- Fixed test_direct_transcription.py to use the consistent working key

## Audio Files Being Tested
- Main container: "shahulin"
- Test file originally tried: "agricultural_finance_(murabaha)_kind.mp3" - DOES NOT EXIST in Azure
- Correct test file that exists: "agricultural_finance_(murabaha)_neutral.mp3"
- Local temp path: "/tmp/deepgram-processing/agricultural_finance_(murabaha)_neutral.mp3"

## Issues Found
1. Inconsistent API key in test_direct_transcription.py - FIXED
2. Incorrect audio file name referenced in logs - IDENTIFIED
3. Testing with correct file name works successfully!
4. Critical container issue - the "shahulin" container appears to be empty - IDENTIFIED
5. Files exist in other containers like "demoout" - IDENTIFIED (but not used)

## Fixes Applied
1. Fixed inconsistent API keys in test_direct_transcription.py
2. Updated project documentation to correctly identify file location issues

## Next Steps
1. Test transcription with files from the correct container
2. Verify that SAS URLs are generated correctly for the files in the demoout container
3. Update any documentation or instructions to reflect the correct container usage
