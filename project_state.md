# Project State Tracker

## Current Issues
- Deepgram transcription error: "Bad Request: failed to process audio: corrupt or unsupported data"
- Despite using the correct API key (ba94baf7840441c378c58ccd1d5202c38ddc42d8), transcription is still failing
- Need to investigate if this is related to:
  - Audio file format/encoding issues
  - SAS URL generation/permissions
  - How the audio content is accessed by Deepgram

## Log Analysis
From recent logs:
```
DEEPGRAM RAW RESPONSE: {"result":null,"error":{"name":"DeepgramApiError","message":"{\"err_code\":\"Bad Request\",\"err_msg\":\"Bad Request: failed to process audio: corrupt or unsupported data\",\"request_id\":\"de726809-56f6-4fc0-baad-8d210a1ccc08\"}","status":400}}
```

## API Key Status
- Environment variable shows: 1f6c8f9cc2378ba0c6c5dd0d60d3d8713f89bfff
- Hardcoded key in files: ba94baf7840441c378c58ccd1d5202c38ddc42d8
- All files now use the hardcoded key directly

## Audio Files Being Tested
- Main container: "shahulin"
- Test file: "agricultural_finance_(murabaha)_kind.mp3"
- Local temp path: "/tmp/deepgram-processing/agricultural_finance_(murabaha)_kind.mp3"

## Hypothesis
1. The issue could be with the audio file format itself - we need to verify the file can be processed
2. The SAS URL might not be correctly generated or have proper permissions
3. The audio content might not be properly accessible via HTTP

## To Be Investigated
- Check functionality of test files (real_azure_test.py) vs. production flow
- Look at SAS URL generation differences
- Examine audio file access methods
