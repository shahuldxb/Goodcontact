# File Size Issue Analysis and Resolution

## Problem Identified
We discovered that the file_size field in the rdt_assets table was showing as 0 for all files processed with the `/direct/transcribe` endpoint, despite successfully transcribing the audio files and storing them in Azure SQL.

## Root Cause
1. The original code was accepting a `file_size` parameter from the client request but not actively fetching the real file size from the Azure Blob
2. The client was not providing a file size, so the default value of 0 was being used
3. The `DirectTranscribeDBEnhanced` class was expecting a non-zero file_size in its store_transcription_result method

## Solution Implemented
1. Created a new enhanced endpoint `/direct/transcribe_v2` that:
   - Explicitly fetches the actual file size from Azure Blob Storage
   - Uses `blob_client.get_blob_properties()` to get accurate size information
   - Passes this accurate file size to the database methods

## Testing and Verification
We conducted comprehensive tests to verify our solution:

1. Created test files:
   - `test_transcribe_v2.py` - Tests the new endpoint and confirms file size is correctly retrieved
   - `test_endpoint_comparison.py` - Directly compares the two endpoints to highlight the difference
   - `check_saved_file_size.py` - Inspects database records to verify file size storage

2. Test results show:
   - Original endpoint: file_size = 0 bytes (incorrect)
   - New v2 endpoint: file_size = 1026864 bytes (correct)

## Implementation Details
The key code changes include:

1. Fetching accurate file size from the blob:
```python
# Get blob properties including size
blob_properties = blob_client.get_blob_properties()
file_size = blob_properties.size
logger.info(f"File {filename} exists with size {file_size} bytes")
```

2. Including the file size in the processing_result:
```python
processing_result = {
    # ... other fields ...
    "file_size": file_size  # Add the actual file size from Azure blob
}
```

## Migration Path
To fix existing records with zero file sizes, a migration script could be created that:
1. Queries all rdt_assets records with file_size = 0
2. For each record, connects to Azure Blob Storage and fetches the actual file size
3. Updates the record with the correct file size

## Recommendations
1. Use the new `/direct/transcribe_v2` endpoint for all future transcriptions
2. Consider migrating existing records to have the correct file size
3. Refactor the original endpoint to include the file size fetching code if backward compatibility is needed
